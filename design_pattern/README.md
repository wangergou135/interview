# Creational patterns 

These patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.

## Factory Method 
        Factory Method is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
## Abstract Factory 
        Abstract Factory is a creational design pattern that lets you produce families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.
## Builder 
## Prototype 
## Singleton 
        Singleton is a creational design pattern that lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance.



# Structural patterns 

These patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.

## Adapter
        Adapter is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate.
## Bridge
## Composite
## Decorator
        Decorator is a structural design pattern that lets you attach new behaviors to objects by placing these objects inside special wrapper objects that contain the behaviors.
## Facade
## Flyweight
## Proxy


# Behavioral patterns 

These patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

## Chain of Responsibility
## Command
        Command is a behavioral design pattern that turns a request into a stand-alone object that contains all information about the request. This transformation lets you pass requests as a method arguments, delay or queue a request’s execution, and support undoable operations. 
## Iterator
        Iterator is a behavioral design pattern that lets you traverse elements of a collection without exposing its underlying representation (list, stack, tree, etc.).
## Mediator
## Memento
## Observer
        Observer is a behavioral design pattern that lets you define a subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects about any events that happen to the object they’re observing.

## State
## Strategy
        Strategy is a behavioral design pattern that lets you define a family of algorithms, put each of them into a separate class, and make their objects interchangeable.
## Template Method
## Visitor

# Concurrency

# Architectural patterns 

## Publish–subscribe
        This pattern involves the publisher and the subscriber relying on a message broker that relays messages from the publisher to the subscribers. The host (publisher) publishes messages (events) to a channel that subscribers can then sign up to.
