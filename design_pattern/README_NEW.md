# Creational patterns 

These patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.

## Factory Method 
## Abstract Factory 
## Builder 
## Prototype 
## Singleton 



# Structural patterns 

These patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.

## Adapter
## Bridge
## Composite
## Decorator
## Facade
## Flyweight
## Proxy


# Behavioral patterns 

These patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

## Chain of Responsibility
## Command
## Iterator
## Mediator
## Memento
## Observer
        Observer is a behavioral design pattern that lets you define a subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects about any events that happen to the object they’re observing.

## State
## Strategy
## Template Method
## Visitor

# Concurrency

# Architectural patterns 

## Publish–subscribe
        This pattern involves the publisher and the subscriber relying on a message broker that relays messages from the publisher to the subscribers. The host (publisher) publishes messages (events) to a channel that subscribers can then sign up to.
